# prompt = "A vibrant cherry red sports car sits proudly under the gleaming sun, its polished exterior smooth and flawless, casting a mirror-like reflection. The car features a low, aerodynamic body, angular headlights that gaze forward like predatory eyes, and a set of black, high-gloss racing rims that contrast starkly with the red. A subtle hint of chrome embellishes the grille and exhaust, while the tinted windows suggest a luxurious and private interior. The scene conveys a sense of speed and elegance, the car appearing as if it's about to burst into a sprint along a coastal road, with the ocean's azure waves crashing in the background."
